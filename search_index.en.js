our quest to establish\nNix for distributing developer toolchains, we depend also\non private, company-specific tools. We do not want to nixify every build but\nsimply fetch the existing build artifacts using GitLab authentication.\nThis might not be exactly what you need but I assume it is incredibly common to\nwant to fetch artifacts from some authenticated API.\nI discussed this with John Ericson and he\ngave me some pointers to current work in progress or proposals that might be\nrelated. Thank you!\nNot exactly being familiar with core Nix development, the impact of these issues\nis not always easy for me to understand. Therefore, I thought it might also help\nothers if I published the notes while reading through the suggested material.\nNix Store ACLs\nReference: RFC 0143\n\nImplement a way to only allow user access to a store path if they provide\nproof that they have all the necessary sources available, or had the access\npermission explicitly granted to them.\n\nWell written!\nObviously, this is related to stores and is superficially nearly the opposite to\nwhat we want: This is about restricting access to parts of a store -- not being\nmore permissive.\nBut, could we not require substitution of all private artifacts? I.e. ensure\nthat all private artifacts are available in our shared Nix store (cache)? The\nfetches would just be \"Fixed Output Derivations\", meaning that they already\nspecify the hash of the fetched artifact, and before attempting the fetch our\nnix client would check if it is already available in the cache.\nThis would not even require this RFC but simply a private Nix store, in our case\nvia AWS S3.\nI have some concerns:\n\nThe fetching \"builder code\" would be misleading since the intention is that it\nwould never be executed. I vaguely remember there is a construct in\nNixpkgs that models \"you need to download\nthis independently and upload it to your store\", so that could be remedied.\nSomeone or something would still need to get access to the artifact and\nupload it to the shared store. That might be relatively easy to achieve (e.g.\nby putting the upload into the CI/CD pipeline of the binary) or difficult,\ndepending as so often on the context. For us, it would be acceptable, even\nthough I'd like to keep the CI/CD pipelines untouched for now so that the nix\nrelated changes keep in a few isolated repos.\nI conceptualize the AWS S3 Store that we set up as \"cache\" that does not need\nto be backed up etc. The requirement of always having all private binaries\navailable there, would invalidate that.\n\nWhere would the RFC be of use for us?\nThe RFC itself mentions that this is probably not a good idea to use this for\nsecrets. So we should not use it to e.g. store GitLab credentials in a store\npath in a protected manner. But I'll think more about that.\nWhat the RFC does allow is to allow access to some binaries without making their\nfull build recipes and source available. That could be nice but is generally not\nour problem: The build of the binaries is not nixified anyways and thus Nix\ndoesn't see the source. Furthermore, all our employees can see pretty much all\nour source code and we like it that way.\nIn theory, the RFC could be a solution for bootstrapping: In our case, for even\nauthenticating, we need certain authentication helpers. With the RFC, we could\nexpose the parts of the store publicly that are strictly needed for\nbootstrapping publicly and all the rest only privately.\nBut all in all, it looks quite complicated to pull off and is not a good match\nfor our needs, I think.\nBuiltin fetching should be represented by derivations\nReference: Nix Github Issue #9077\nCurrently, there are two fundamental different ways of \"fetching\":\n\n\n\"built-in fetchers\" (libfetchers): These are functions of \"Nix the language\" and are\nexecuted directly while evaluating the build tree.\n\n\n\"fixed-output derivation fetchers\": Nix allows them to access the network by\nvirtue of an easily verifiable promise. FODs need to specify the hash of\ntheir output upfront.\n\n\nThis has some indirect consequences which is why, depending on their needs,\nprefer one over the other.\n\"Built-in\" fetchers run wherever the Nix expressions are evaluated - in the\nenvironment of the user that invoked the build. That has an immediate\napplication for us: If the user is authenticated, the fetcher also has\naccess to the associated credentials!\nYet, it also requires that we have an appropriate fetcher directly built into\nNix, which makes this weirdly inflexible: The built-in fetchers do not e.g.\nallow setting an authentication header from an environment variable. That makes\nit impossible fetching job artifacts via the GitLab API that does not allow\nbasic authentication\nwhich would be supported via credentials via the insanely limited, not even\nsupporting passwords with spaces time-proven netrc mechanism.\nIn addition to this inflexibility due to the nature of being in the Nix code\n(live with what we Elders have foreseen, Young Jedi), there are also performance issues,\ne.g. builtin-fetchers are only executed one by one and not in parallel with\nderivations. This is what the issues strives to fix that and more (I believe).\nThat is really cool!\nI am not clear, though, if this would mean that the built-in fetchers would\nstill be executed by the build\nclient, e.g.\nthe user that called nix build. Let's assume that in good faith for now,\notherwise this would make authentication more difficult not easier. (Note from\nfuture Peter: This gets actually addressed in the next section!)\nSo in a future world where Nix contained a built-in fetcher suitable for GitLab,\nthis could mitigate some of the downsides of built-in fetchers.\nHow would it work then with remote builders?\nFor the first time:\n\nnix build gets invoked.\nFetch from GitLab running in the same process or at least environment as the\nnix build process so it has access to all user authentication.\nThe result is uploaded to the builders from the local machine...\nbuild continues\nSomeway or the other, the result of the fetch ends up in our shared Nix\nstore/substituter.\n\nAfterwards:\n\nnix build gets invoked.\nThe result gets substituted which is also fast on remote builders.\nBuild continues...\n\nNot too bad, but actually nearly not at all dependent on issue #9077. It mostly\ndepends on supporting GitLab by having more flexible built-in fetchers.\nPotentially, I could do that with a nix plugin or patch.\nWhat is really cool about this solution is that the credentials never leave the\nclient. Which makes it both simple and secure. But implementing that issue in a\nway that would allow executing these fetches in parallel but on the client is\nnot really trivial.\nBTW, built-in fetchers have other super powers (e.g. not necessarily\nrequiring an output hash but simply a git hash) and FODs have some other problems\n(e.g. being unwantedly substituted when the URL but not the hash is\nchanged).\nOptional client-side building\nReference: Nix Github Issue #9344\n\n\nFor fixed output derivations that need authentication, it is probably\nbetter to run them as the current user in order to give them secrets,\nespecially ephemeral secrets (like expiring tokens) that might require some\nhumans in the loop (various 2fa schemes) and are cumbersome to store in the\nstore.\nBuiltin fetching should be represented by derivations #9077 once the above\nis sorted out, we should do this too. Currently the main reason fetching is\nnot done with derivations is authentication. This provides a proper\nsolution. All fetching done as client-side derivations nicely meets in the\nmiddle of the current fixed-output derivations vs libfetchers divide.\n\n\nHuh! John addressed my previous concerns here without me even realizing. Thanks\nagain!\nAfter this John dives directly into implementation details that are hard to\nfollow for me:\n\n\nGeneral decoupling. Building shouldn't depend on using the SQL database\n(and I don't think it currently does). It ought to work with other stores that\nalso provide a bike system view.\n\n\nI assume that he means \"build system view\" but I can't follow the relationship to\nthe SQLite database.\nConclusion\nIt was interesting to learn about the different proposals. Some of them would be\nawesome improvements, the last one would nearly solve my problem.\nShort term I see the following possibilities for allowing private fetches from\nGitLab:\n\nPatching nix or writing a plugin so that I can use a more flexible fetchurl\nbuilt-in\nthat supports setting headers from environment variables. That would allow me\nto pass credentials without somehow having them end up in the store.\nUsing a custom FOD to fetch from GitLab and have a mechanism to pass the\nGitLab API token to the builder.\n\nThe second one could be easily achieved by similar means as described\nhere: E.g.\nallowing trusted clients to change allowlisted environment variables in the\nbuilder. Since that is not possible yet and requires further discussion, I\nimplemented a hacky way to do that in our internal PoC. I might write a separate\nblog post about that!\nIf you want to know more about my current journey and context, check out Nix:\nDistributing private/public\nbinaries.\nNoticed a mistake?

And that is\na shame because CLIs are awesome:\n\n\nComposable. It is very easy to write a little wrapper around another CLI that\nadds some functionality.\n\n\nEasy to write. Much easier than a web app.\n\n\n...\n\n\nI should write another article on that!\nThe problem\nYou say: \"How hard is it really? Can't you do a release on GitLab/GitHub and\nprovide some download links? They are already protected by private\nauthentication.\"\nYeah, sure. But there are some problems:\n\n\nVersion consistency. Everyone might download the binaries they need on\ndemand resulting in a unique versioning footprint on every dev machine. Or are\nyou naive enough that your developers update their kubectl version with plugins\nand third-party tools relying on it when you announce a new Kubernetes upgrade?\nThere are more fun ways to spend your time than asking again and again: Have\nyou upgraded CLI X yet?\n\n\nPackaging different language runtimes. Yeah, your Go or Rust binary might be\nsomewhat easy to distribute. What about a Python script? A TypeScript CLI? So\nyou need to package the runtime environment for your script as well. But not\ninterfere with the local development setup.\n\n\nThe solution?\nnix &amp; the nixpkgs* collection.\nNix is many things but it is also a package manager that\nworks on Linux/Mac OS. It does NOT support Windows directly but my coworkers\nare fine with working in a WSL2 shell.\n\n\nAwesome direnv integration: Imagine the right set of tools automatically\navailable to you if you enter a project directory! And that also sets up commit\nhooks etc for you. That is direnv + nix. Have a look at\ndevenv if you want to play around with it quickly!\n\n\nnixpkgs collection: A vast collection of prepackaged\nsoftware, your favorite programming\nlanguage tooling is most likely among them.\n\n\nFlake ecosystem: Flakes are a simple way to package nix libraries and binaries\noutside of the main nixpkgs collection.\n\n\nVery flexible packaging options:\n- Already have some binaries? Great! You can integrate them into your\n  package bundle by supplying a download URL and a hash for all of them.\n\n- Bundle up your Python script with a runtime environment? Quite easy.\n\n- ...\n\n\n\nWorks alongside other package managers! Your users can keep using home brew or\ntheir native package managers for their personal preferences. Nix will not\noverwrite the global Python installation just because your script needs it.\nEven if you make tools available via direnv for a project, they are only in\nyour path when you are in the project folder!\n\n\nEcosystem\nThe Nix ecosystem is thriving. E.g. look at the commits in the\nnixpkgs repository to have a glimpse at the\nvibrant open source community! There are also multiple popular communication\nchannels where you can get help and discuss your\nideas.\nBut the ecosystem definitely also profits from contributions of various\ncompanies including Big Tech and companies fairly specialized on Nix or builds.\nNeed commercial support? You are covered.\nThere are several companies that bet on using Nix as a basis for dev tooling so\nI am sure that package support will even get better.\nThe rough edges of nix itself\nFlake's status*: You remember Flakes that I mentioned above? Well, technically,\nthis is an experimental feature. They have been around for years, whole\necosystems have been built around it, but officially, they might still change in\nincompatible ways!\nI am obviously not the only one that has noticed this as a big problem and the\nconsensus is that while not officially stable, they have such wide-spread use\nthat keeping them working is a big priority nevertheless.\nSimple but exotic language: The Nix ecosystem is built around the nix\nprogramming language. That is a simple and mostly well-designed language but it\nis not mainstream. The combination of being dynamically typed and lazy-evaluated\nby default makes debugging sometimes quite cumbersome.\nNix allows some amazing freedom but it can be hard to orient at times: E.g. Nix\ndoesn't impose much structure on your code and you need to rely on best\npractices on which there are diverse opinions.\nUsing nix in the enterprise\nIn my company, I have just started the journey and only completed the first\nsteps. Here is an outline of what I did and am about to do. Feel free to chime\nin and suggest better paths for me!\nStreamline the nix installation experience\nWhat do I want?\n\n\nSimple installation instructions with as few steps as possible.\n\n\nShould work for developers who already set up some things and for people that\nhave just started in the company.\n\n\nIf you run it again, it should simply update everything to the latest software\nversion and config version.\n\n\nTherefore, I created\nnix-bootstrap that takes care\nof:\n\n\nInstalling nix with\nnix-installer. I love\nDeterminate System's mission to get rid of annoying papercuts like e.g. broken\ninstalls after Mac OS upgrades.\n\n\nDeterministic versions of nix-installer, nix, and\nnom. Rather than just\nalways installing the latest ones.\n\n\nWorking shell completions for nix commands and other software installed in\nthe user profile. This will hopefully be\nfixed in the installer\nscript of nix that nix-installer also uses. Meanwhile I included a fix in\nnix-bootstrap.\n\n\nInstalling direnv. direnv is unfortunately out of scope for\nnix-installer,\nso I also install it as part of the bootstrap nix profile that I install\nsystem-wide and for the installing user.\n\n\nSetting up credentials for private GitLab repositories.\n\n\nAll triggered with a simple shell command:\nbash -c \"$(curl https://nexxiot-labs.gitlab.io/nix-bootstrap/install.sh)\"\n\nI am happy to collaborate with others on improving this or upstreaming fixes to\nnix/nix-installer.\nCI support for nix in GitLab\nGenerally, the main nix projects are all on GitHub and, therefore, GitHub is\nbetter supported by the ecosystem. That said, using GitLab CI with nix is not\nsuper difficult.\n\n\nCreating a CI container. Nicely minimal but still everything that is needed.\nE.g. GitLab CI expects a grep before I even get a chance to execute a nix\ncommand to install it. nixpkgs/nix-flakes is nicely minimal and does not\ninclude it. I used the new cool kid on the block nix2container but it has a\nproblem that gets only triggered if you build the container itself within that\ncontainer.\n\n\nAllowing CI access to a nix substituter (= cache). Allowing read/write access\nto an S3 bucket was easy in our setup but it is much harder to share that\naccess with users -- see below.\n\n\nAllowing nix in GitLab CI to fetch binary artifacts from other private repos.\nAbsolutely not straight-forward to inject the right credentials into the fetch\nbuild step, especially since GitLab does not support Basic Auth in its\nAPI. Please say I am\nwrong and there is an easy way!\n\n\nMac OS binaries. At least for our internal CLI tools, we'd want Mac OS support\nbut we don't have CI runners for Mac OS and cross-compiling is tricky and\nmaybe not even reliably possible. Maybe I'll just test &amp; push them manually\ninto the cache on releases.\n\n\nLocal install support\nIf users install an unchanged flake, read-access to a binary cache (=substituter\nin nix lingo) should be sufficient. If that is prefilled by CI and/or manual\nsteps as needed -- all cache requests should be hits.\nUnfortunately, we only allow temporary AWS session credentials for our users.\nPassing those to the nix-daemon is\nnot really possible.\nUsing Cachix instead would be a serious contender\nwith fair prices. Unfortunately, that would require additional onboarding /\noffboarding steps for both our IT and the developers itself. Maybe that can be\nsolved with SSO support in the future!\nWhat is more, all systems we interact with, need to be approved by our Internal\nIT reviews. For AWS S3, since we are already using it, this is not necessary.\nSo here I am still wondering what the best path forward is!\nLocal build support\nObviously, local builds should also work when working on internal tool release.\nSo we need to solve the authentication problem to the GitLab API (for fetching\nbinary artifacts) not only in CI but also for every developer.\nMaybe I can build sort of a \"doctor\" script that takes care of ensuring that all\nnecessary secrets are set up and that the nix-daemon can access them?\nDevContainer/GitPod support\nWhat about allowing our developers to dabble with nix tools without even\ninstalling nix on their computer?\nDevcontainer\nsupport in Visual\nCode is quite awesome. A lot of our developers use Intellij -- WSL2 remote\nsupport seems to be better than devcontainer support in my testing, so probably\nnot helpful for those users.\nComplementarily, GitPod would be a super nice test bed that\ncould be easily used from our GitLab repositories.\nAuthentication within a devcontainer hopefully just works similarly to doing it\nlocally outside of the container -- with the right volume mounts. But it might\nbe also a big pain!\nFor GitPod, it is likely a completely different flow.\nCache Pruning\nJust expiring files after 30 days or so doesn't work with nix since it breaks\nsome invariants: All dependencies of a derivation are also assumed to be\navailable via the cache (I think).\nTherefore, implementing a nice expiry policy is more involved. E.g. maintaining\na list of store paths that are still relevant for recent builds and pruning\neverything else.\nA journey...\nPuuuh... That is quite a journey ahead of me! I believe it can unlock a lot of\nproductivity by easy tool distribution in my company but it doesn't look that\neasy!\nThanks for reading until here.\nI am thankful for any pointers to make this smoother. Feel free to get in touch\nwith me with the information shared on my GitHub profile:\nkolloch\n","id":"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/2023-nix-for-private-binaries/","title":"Nix: Distributing private/public binaries"},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/2023-nix-s3-store-authentication/":{"body":"Private stores? Temporary credentials? At the time of\nwriting this, definitely not easy! (Please, please prove me wrong!)\nAt the end of this article I'll make a pragmatic proposal that should be quite\neasy to implement and improve the user experience significantly.\nStores: What's possible today?\n\"Stores\" store build results and allow you to share them between\nmachines.\nYou can copy packages (store paths) with their transitive dependencies (closure)\nbetween machines explicitly, e.g. with nix copy or nix-copy-closure.\nYou can also use them as a cache (substituter) during builds: For suitable build\nsteps (derivations), Nix will check if the result has already been build and is\navailable for download.\nHow can we authenticate towards private stores? That depends on the store type:\n\n\nSSH. Well with the usual SSH mechanisms.\n\n\nHTTPS. You can use .netrc to provide basic auth credentials.\n\n\nAWS S3. Uses the AWS SDK's\nAws::Auth::AWSCredentialsProvider\nwhich e.g. search for credentials in environment variables and configuration\nfiles.\n\n\nHow do you provide these credentials? It depends on the context in which the\nstore is used.\n\nnix copy: The credentials e.g. for AWS are taken from the invoking user or\nthe environment in which nix runs.\nSubstitution with single-user setup without daemon: Same.\nSubstitution but with nix-daemon: Credentials are resolved in the environment\nof the nix-daemon or from the config files of the nix-daemon user.\n\nThat is already super confusing. You have entered an AWS session with temporary\ncredentials available in environment variables:\n\nnix copy just works.\nnix build cannot use the substituter when it uses the nix-daemon.\n\nCachix: State of the art for HTTPS stores\nCachix uses a CLI to make this as convenient as possible:\n\nIt assumes you are a trusted user that can change nix-daemon settings on the\nfly.\nIt updates your nix.conf with a potential private cache and a net-rc file\nsetting.\nnix copy takes this config directly and works.\nnix build passes this config to the nix-daemon that can hopefully also read\nyour net-rc file.\n\nPassing the config to the nix-daemon is implemented via daemon op\nSetOptions\nwhich changes the Settings globally. That is fine, because the nix-daemon is\nforked for every connection.\nWhat are the problems?\n\nNeed to patch your nix-config. This is potentially not that bad!\nRemote builders need additional server-side config. The config options might\nactually even be transfered with the SetOptions command, not sure, but your\nnet-rc file is likely unavailable on the remote builder. Might be OK if you\ndon't use them or someone else sets them up for you!\nDoes not work well with temporary credentials. Might be a showstopper in some\nenvironments.\nOnly works for HTTP(S) with Basic Authenticationstores. Yeah, well, if you use\nsomething else... Doesn't work with AWS S3...\n\nAWS S3: State of the art solution\nIf you have a single user nix setup, it is rather easy. Is your user\nauthenticated and authorized to access the S3 store? So is nix running as that\nuser.\nIt becomes more annoying if you use a nix-daemon: You also need to provide the\ncredentials to the nix-daemon. If you use\nPragmatic User-Friendly Solution\nI assume that your trust your nix-daemon or remote builder. I think that's fair\nand the assumption behind the approach that cachix uses.\nWhile netrc works pretty decently for Cachix, it doesn't match AWS well since\nit doesn't use Basic Authentication. Remember, the complicated logic is already\nall inside of the nix-daemon via the AWS SDK, we just need to pass a couple of\nvalues to the nix-daemon.\nI see two major approaches:\n\n\nCustom logic for AWS: Either extend SetOptions or create a new operation to\ntransfer AWS credentials and store them in special-purpose fields. Modify the\ncredential provider chain to also look there for credentials.\n\n\nA general way to transfer environment variables from the nix client to the\ndaemon for the current session.\n\n\nDetails for passing environment variables to the daemon\nI like the second one better because it would also solve the problem if we\nintegrated solutions for other cloud providers. And it might even be an\nacceptable workaround for fetches from private sources in builds (more about\nthat later).\nI'd restrict this features with some explicit config options.\n\n\nIn the nix-daemon: allowed-env-variables-from-trusted-client as a list of\nenvironment variables that may be set from a trusted client. E.g.:\nallowed-env-variables-from-trusted-client = AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_DEFAULT_REGION\n\n\n\nFor the nix client: pass-env-variables as a list of environment variables\nthat are passed whenever a connection to the nix-daemon is opened. E.g.:\npass-env-variables = AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_DEFAULT_REGION\n\n\n\nIf a client has valid AWS environment variables, this will make it just work,\neven with temporary credentials. \n\n\nnix copy / nix build will just both work after adding a few standard\nconfig options.\n\n\nThe config can remain static while the credentials can change.\n\n\nYey!\nIt might even work with remote builds: at least if the SetOptions op is also\nused there.\nRestrictions:\n\n\nThis requires the client to have a valid AWS session whenever you might\naccess the AWS S3 store. It cannot prompt for e.g. your MFA code on demand.\n\n\nIf the nix-daemon implementation ever changes and does not fork on every new\nconnection, then changing the global environment variables of the process is\nalso a nono. Note though, that a lot of the implementation would need to\nchange in that case.\n\n\nConclusion\nI can definitely think of other solutions here but this seems to have the right\nmix of \"good enough\", \"not too specialized\" and \"easy to implement.\"\nI might be wrong, though, and would love to hear your thoughts!\nIf you want to know more about my current journey and context, check out Nix:\nDistributing private/public\nbinaries.\nFeel free to get in touch\nwith me with the information shared on my GitHub profile:\nkolloch\n","id":"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/2023-nix-s3-store-authentication/","title":"Nix in the Enterprise: AWS S3 Store Authentication"},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/2023-nix2container-everything-once/":{"body":"I love nix2container!

Nice!\nDeduplication (automatic)\nWouldn't it be nice if later layers always skipped all store paths already\ncontained in earlier layers?\nThis being nix, this is easy to generalize:\n{ # ...\n  # Nest all layers so that prior layers are dependencies of later layers.\n  # This way, we should avoid redundant dependencies.\n  foldImageLayers = let\n    mergeToLayer = priorLayers: component:\n      assert builtins.isList priorLayers;\n      assert builtins.isAttrs component; let\n        layer = nix2container.buildLayer (component\n          // {\n            layers = priorLayers;\n          });\n      in\n        priorLayers ++ [layer];\n  in\n    layers: lib.foldl mergeToLayer [] layers;\n}\n\nEach layer will reference all prior layers in the layers attribute. This might\nbe problematic with a large number of layers -- but hasn't been problematic so\nfar for me. I am sure one can optimize it.\nPutting foldImageLayers to good use:\n{ # ...\n  layeredDeduplicatedAutomatic = nix2container.buildImage {\n    name = \"layeredAutomatic\";\n    layers = \n      let layerDefs = [\n        { deps = with nixpkgs; [ readline ]; }\n        { deps = with nixpkgs; [ bashInteractive ]; }\n        { deps = with nixpkgs; [ zsh ]; }\n      ];\n      in foldImageLayers layerDefs;\n    config = {\n      Env = [\n        (let path = with nixpkgs; lib.makeBinPath [ bashInteractive zsh ];\n        in \"PATH=${path}\")\n      ];\n    };\n  };\n}\n\nThis results again in a docker image without any redundant store paths!

I didn't even know that existed!\n\"Global\" .gitignore\nIf you have a look at git's .gitignore\ndocumentation, you'll see that there are\nfour sources of ignore patterns that git considers:\n\nfrom command line flags, where applicable,\nfrom .gitignore files in project directories,\n.git/info/exclude in the project directory,\nAND, tadaah, I didn't know about that at all: from a file specified in the\ncore.excludesFile option.\n\nWhile there is not a standard place for a \"global\" gitignore file, you can add\none to your \"global\" user git config.

It should\nbe committed with the rest.\nChoose nodejs version\nAlright. For astro/starlight, we are going to need nodejs with npm.\nLet's chose a nodejs version and put it into the exported\npackages of the flake. That way we can already test run it\nand refer to it from other config files:\n# flake-modules/nodejs-packages.nix\n{\n  perSystem = { pkgs, ... }: {\n    packages.nodejs = pkgs.nodejs_21;\n  };\n}\n\nNow add this file to the imports in flake.nix:\n# flake.nix\n# ...\n  imports = [\n    ./flake-modules/nodejs-packages.nix\n  ];\n# ...\n\nAdd the file to git and execute nix flake check to notice any errors.\nWe can also test the nodejs version that we chose:\n❯ nix run .#nodejs\nwarning: Git tree '/Users/.../projects/astro-starlight-with-nix' is dirty\nWelcome to Node.js v21.5.0.\nType \".help\" for more information.\n\nSetup devshell\nThis is not so convenient... yet.\nLet's make sure that we and our contributors all use the same version!\n# flake-modules/nodejs-devshell.nix\n{ inputs, ...}: {\n  imports = [\n    inputs.devshell.flakeModule\n  ];\n\n  perSystem = { config, ... }: {\n    devshells.default = {\n      commands = [\n        { package = config.packages.nodejs; category = \"docs\"; }\n      ];\n    };\n  };\n}\n\nNotice the config.packages.nodejs? Here we are referring\nto the nodejs package definition that we setup before.\nNow add this file to the imports in flake.nix:\n# flake.nix\n# ...\n    imports = [\n      ./flake-modules/nodejs-packages.nix\n      ./flake-modules/nodejs-devshell.nix\n    ];\n# ...\n\nAnd now add the new file to git and run nix flake check.\nNoticing a pattern? Well, get used to it ;)\nNow we can enter a devshell with node and npm provided\nby nix:\n❯ nix develop\nwarning: Git tree '/Users/.../projects/astro-starlight-with-nix' is dirty\n🔨 Welcome to devshell\n\n[[general commands]]\n\n  menu   - prints this menu\n\n[docs]\n\n  nodejs - Event-driven I/O framework for the V8 JavaScript engine\n\n[devshell]$ which npm\n/nix/store/3h53w5zkwpyapp8510d6ivmhmf47x0bs-devshell-dir/bin/npm\n[devshell]$ which node\n/nix/store/3h53w5zkwpyapp8510d6ivmhmf47x0bs-devshell-dir/bin/node\n[devshell]$\nexit\n\nYou can exit the shell on Unix-like OSes with CTRL+D or by typing \"exit\".\nAdding an .envrc for direnv\nAll this entering and exiting. Here come direnv to automate that step for us!\nCreate a new file:\n# .envrc\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n# ^ make editor happy\n\n#\n# Use https://direnv.net/ to automatically load the dev shell.\n#\n\n# Update this by looking at https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv#installation\n# under \"Direnv source\"\nif ! has nix_direnv_version || ! nix_direnv_version 3.0.4; then\n  source_url \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nix-community/nix-direnv/3.0.4/direnvrc\" \"sha256-DzlYZ33mWF/Gs8DDeyjr8mnVmQGx7ASYqA5WlxwvBG4=\"\nfi  \n\nwatch_file -- flake-modules/*.nix\nuse flake . --show-trace\n\nIf you press enter on the shell prompt now and you have direnv set up\nproperly, you should get something like:\ndirenv: error /Users/.../projects/astro-starlight-with-nix/.envrc is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its content\n\nWell, we'll do as we are told:\n❯ direnv allow .\ndirenv: loading ~/projects/astro-starlight-with-nix/.envrc\ndirenv: loading https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nix-community/nix-direnv/3.0.4/direnvrc (sha256-DzlYZ33mWF/Gs8DDeyjr8mnVmQGx7ASYqA5WlxwvBG4=)\ndirenv: using flake . --show-trace\ndirenv: nix-direnv: using cached dev shell\n🔨 Welcome to devshell\n\n[[general commands]]\n\n  menu   - prints this menu\n\n[docs]\n\n  nodejs - Event-driven I/O framework for the V8 JavaScript engine\n\ndirenv: export +DEVSHELL_DIR +IN_NIX_SHELL +NIXPKGS_PATH +PRJ_DATA_DIR +PRJ_ROOT +name ~PATH ~XDG_DATA_DIRS\n\nAwesome! Now we have npm and nodejs with the chosen version in our PATH\nwhenever we are in this directory.\nIt also creates a .direnv folder that you probably want to add to your .gitignore:\necho \".direnv\" &gt;&gt;.gitignore\n\nChecking your flake with nix repl\nnix repl would deserve its own blog article or book but to get your started:\n❯ nix repl\nWelcome to Nix 2.18.1. Type :? for help.\n\nnix-repl&gt; :lf .\nwarning: Git tree '/Users/peterkolloch/projects/astro-starlight-with-nix' is dirty\nAdded 20 variables.\n\n:lf . stands for \"load flake\" and has to be followed by a path. Here,\nthe current directory.\nNow the outputs of the flake are discoverable in the outputs attribute\nin the shell. You can use tab completion (i.e. hit TAB after outputs.):\nnix-repl&gt; outputs.\noutputs.apps                 outputs.checks               outputs.devShells            outputs.formatter            outputs.legacyPackages       outputs.nixosConfigurations  outputs.nixosModules         outputs.overlays             outputs.packages\nnix-repl&gt; outputs.devShells\noutputs.devShells\nnix-repl&gt; outputs.devShells.\noutputs.devShells.aarch64-darwin  outputs.devShells.aarch64-linux   outputs.devShells.x86_64-darwin   outputs.devShells.x86_64-linux\nnix-repl&gt; outputs.devShells.aarch64-darwin.default\n\nYou see that there are attributes for each system (architecture) that \nwe defined our flake for.\nUpdating all dependencies\nIf you want to use a nodejs version from a more recent nixpkgs later,\nyou'll have to update your flake dependencies. That is as easy as:\nnix flake update\n\nVSCode support\nDid you know that you can actually force VSCode and some other IDEs to use\nexactly the same nodejs version for builds that you specified?\nFor VSCode you can use the direnv plugin. There are a couple of them. This\nis the one that I use currently.\nTo help fellow VSCode users find the extension quickly, you can add the following\nfile to the project:\n// .vscode/extensions.json\n{\n    \"recommendations\": [\n        \"rubymaniac.vscode-direnv\"\n    ]\n}\n\nConclusion\nNow we have set up a very simple dev shell with a pinned nodejs version\nthat is convenient to use. That is a big help to onboard anyone onto the project.\nWe did it step-by step by adding little tiny flake-module.nix files to our flake.\nThis was convenient for this tutorial but actually also works well in practice.\nIf you scope one flake-module.nix to one purpose, it remains easy to understand.\nA good basis - let's soon add more on top!

Often, I only noticed problems with the raw\nfootage on my Desktop computer at home - long after I could correct them by a\nsimple retake. Wouldn't it be awesome to record your footage directly to your\nlaptop? Make the footage available to others in your team really quickly, maybe\nby storing it on a server?\nI want to do this on my XPS 13 since that is my most portable option. I should\nnote that my laptop is decent (Intel i7-8550U 1.8 GHz) but doesn't have a\ndiscrete graphics card. In fact, I cannot even play back the 4K footage recorded\non my Fuji XT-3 with HEVC (h265) on my laptop without tweaking VLC. And even on\nmy hefty AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2950X 16-Core, I cannot encode on the CPU alone\nin realtime.\nTherefore, encoding in realtime should probably be impossible. Or not? I had to\ntry. Oh, and on Linux. NixOS to be specific.\nNote that this article is not full of deep insights but mostly contains things I\ntried and then eventually worked. This kind of content has helped me\ntremendously in the past, so let's dump it into the Interwebs.\nThe easy way: OBS\nThe first thing that I tried was OBS studio. Here is what somewhat worked for me:\n\nI set the output of my camera to 4K, 16:9, 25 fps (full HD does not work)\nI added a Video Capture (V4L2) source. I needed to set the video format to\nYV12 which is apparently an alias for NV12.\nI added a Audio Input Capture (Pulse Audio) since the video source does not\ninclude the audio.\n\nIt somewhat worked. But it randomly stopped working. It dropped frames -- that\ngot better when I disabled the preview. Anyways, if you reading this some time\nafter I published this, give it a try, it might be the simplest option!\nTherefore, I decided to use CLI tools to\nunderstand what was going on and to ultimately have more control. I dabbled a\nbit with gstreamer but ultimately chose ffmpeg because I found more and\nbetter documentation for it and it seemed to work better.\nDigging deeper: Required Software\nIf you want to follow along, I installed these packages in NixOS by adding them\nto my package list:\n# Capturing and encoding\nffmpeg-full # My version was 4.2.2\n\n# Inspect video devices etc.\nv4l-utils\nusbutils\n\n# Hardware acceleration for encoding/decoding\nvaapiIntel\nlibva\nlibva-utils\n\nUnderlying video device\nffmpeg and other CLI tools require us to specify the video device name -- at\nleast if you have multiple video inputs e.g. the built-in webcam and the Elgato\nCamlink 4K. You can either use the /dev/videoX device name that you saw in OBS\nStudio or find the device names with:\nv4l2-ctl --list-devices\nCam Link 4K: Cam Link 4K (usb-0000:39:00.0-1.2):\n\t/dev/video1\n\t/dev/video2\n\nYou can already use the device names (the first one for the Cam Link) that you\nfound here. The trouble is that these device names might depend on the order in\nwhich the video devices are detected. To get a stable device name that works\nacross reboots in you shell scripts, you can look into /dev/v4l/by-id\ndirectory to find a good stable device name. For my devicem it was\n/dev/v4l/by-id/usb-Elgato_Cam_Link_4K_0004550EAA000-video-index0.\nWe'll refer to whatever device you have chosen with V4L_DEVICE later in the\ntext.\nPlaying the video feed\nTo check whether ffmpeg can play the stream, you can use:\nffplay -f v4l2 -i $V4L_DEVICE\nThat is super simple, isn't it? It even detects the video format correctly. If\nit doesn't for you, try specifying one with -input_format, e.g. -input_format nv12 before the -i.\nCapture the video feed\nWhat does ffmpeg do by default? Let's see by exchanging ffplay with ffmpeg\nand specifying an output file:\nffmpeg -f v4l2 -i $V4L_DEVICE capture.mkv\nHey, that works! But only barely. \n\nI cannot encode the video in real time and the video is buffered. The raw\nvideo feed with 29.97 fps clocks in at about 3Gb/s, a bit less for 25 fps. If\nwe can't keep up, ffmpeg buffers the rest in main memory. So only suitable for\nquite short videos ;)\nAlso, the output is ugly, we need to specify something nicer.\n\nHardware-encoding to the rescue\nSince my laptop does not have a discrete graphics card, I am using the \"VAAPI\"\nstandard which is supported by newer Intel CPUs.\nffmpeg -vaapi_device /dev/dri/renderD128 \\\n  -f v4l2 -input_format nv12 -i $V4L_DEVICE \\\n  -vf 'hwupload' \\\n  -c:v hevc_vaapi -b:v 100M -maxrate:v 120M capture.mkv\n\nWoooh! That's a lot to understand.\nLet's start with the basics: A basic ffmpeg command consists of a some global\nflags (-vaapi_device /dev/dri/renderD128 in this case) list of inputs (-i ...) and a list of outputs (e.g. file names). Local options effect the next\ninput or output, so decoding options are specified before an input, encoding\noptions for the output are specified before the output file name. -f v4l2 -input_format nv12 apply to the input. -c:v hevc_vaapi -b:v 100M -maxrate:v 120M all apply to the output capture.mkv.\nBetween our input and the output, there is a -vf video filter command which\ncan be used to process the raw video. You could scale the video, transform the\ncolor space, things like that. In our case, we need to make the video stream\navailable in the hardware encoder with hwupload. That seems to a bit of a\nspecialty with the VAAPI support. In my short experimentation with the NVIDIA\nsupport (nvenc) on another machine, I didn't need something similar.\n-c:v hevc_vaapi is used to choose the video codec (-c is for codec, :v is\nfor video) from a long list of supported once. The codecs that use VAAPI have\na _vaapi suffix by convention.\nWithout specifying the wanted and maximum bit rate, I got a stream with low\nquality. Therefore, I specified -b:v 100M -maxrate:v 120M to aim at quite high\nquality. The highest quality setting on the X-T3 for 4K 25fps is 400Mbs, so it\nmight be even worth to experiment with higher settings. Note that there is a\nbug that requires you to specify a\nmaxrate that is not much higher than the wanted bit rate.\nUsing VAAPI, I could encode 25 fps in realtime. Unfortunately, 29.97 is already\ntoo much. That unfortunately also means that my plan to encode a smaller,\nlow-quality stream at the same time, also failed.\nThe FFMPEG VAAPI Wiki\nPage gives context and many useful\nexamples if you want to know more.\nAudio source\nThe audio feed is - unfortunately - separate from the video feed.\nFirst, let me save you a day of fiddling. Don't use ALSA directly, use\nPulseAudio directly if you use it on your system. Using ALSA directly from\nffmpeg resulted in clapping a lot to debug audio sync issues and thus driving my\ngirl-friend insane.\nUse pactl list sources to output tons of information about your audio sources.\nChoose the right device and pick the name. For me, it was\nalsa_input.usb-Elgato_Systems_Cam_Link-03.iec958-stereo.\nCapture the audio feed\nThis is straight-forward, we just have to specify that we want to use PulseAudio\n(by -f pulse) and specify the device name as input.\nffmpeg -f pulse -i alsa_input.usb-Elgato_Systems_Cam_Link-03.iec958-stereo capture.mp3\n\nWe skip compression to save some CPU when we do everything together later on:\nffmpeg -f pulse -i alsa_input.usb-Elgato_Systems_Cam_Link-03.iec958-stereo \\\n    -c:a copy capture.wav\n\n-c:a copy set the audio codec to copy which skips any audio encoding. In\nthis case, it is redundant since the output format doesn't support any special\ncodec anyways. It becomes relevant when we combine it with video.\nPutting it together... doesn't work\nThis mostly combines our video/audio examples and adds a -thread_queue_size 2048 to allow some generous buffering:\nfmpeg -vaapi_device /dev/dri/renderD128 \\\n    -i $V4L_DEVICE \\\n    -thread_queue_size 2048 -f pulse -i $PULSE_DEVICE \\\n    -vf 'format=nv12,hwupload' \\\n    -c:v hevc_vaapi -b:v 100M -maxrate:v 120M \\\n    -acodec copy \\\n    output-combined.mkv\n\nThis should be the final section, right? I'd hope so but for me this wasn't true\nat all.\nThis might work for you. For me, it also worked once or so. Unfortunately, most\nof the time it will get stuck after two frames. After some random\nexperimentation, I noticed that unplugging the device allowed me to record once,\nmost of the time. I think that it is due to syncing the audio / video stream.\nThe video source seems to request key frames doesn't get the expected data\nafterwards. Or something else.\nResetting the USB device without unplugging\nThat's not nice but can we at least automate it? After some browsing, I found\nthis recipe on Ask Ubuntu:\nsudo sh -c \"echo 0 &gt; /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-4.6/authorized\"\nsudo sh -c \"echo 1 &gt; /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-4.6/authorized\"\n\nI created two shell scripts \n\nfind-elgato4k-sys-dir.sh\nto find the right sys directory and \nreset.sh\nto issue these commands and wait for the device to come up again.\n\nConclusion\nAfter calling reset.sh, the combined command works reliably for me. And I have\na new found respect for the codecs in my camera.\nIf you benefitted from this article or, even better, improved upon it, please\nlet me know, e.g. on Twitter.\n","id":"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/ffmpeg-elgato-camlink-4k/","title":"ffmpeg: Capture & encode a 4K stream in realtime using VAAPI"},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/git-ssh-insteadof-https/":{"body":"In my workflow with Git, I prefer using SSH\nauthentication for platforms like GitHub and\nGitLab.

This means you can continue using HTTPS URLs\nin your .gitmodules file, but when you clone or pull locally, it will use SSH.\nIt also works for git clone.\nI have no idea how I missed this feature before, but it's certainly a quality of\nlife improvement.\n","id":"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/git-ssh-insteadof-https/","title":"Git: Using SSH Locally, But HTTPS in CI"},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/nix-rerunning-fixed-output-derivations/":{"body":"If you instantiate this derivation on your local machine, it will fail1:\n    nix repl ‘&lt;nixpkgs&gt;’\n\n    nix-repl&gt; :b runCommandLocal \"myfetch\" {\n              \toutputHash =  \"sha256:04jnq6arig0amz0scadavbzn9bg9k4zphmrm1562n6ygfj1dnj45\";\n          \t} ''Garbage.

A derivation with such a\npredetermined output hash is called “Fixed Output Derivation” or, abbreviated,\n“FOD”.\nThis prevents you from silently introducing randomness into your build. If you\ninteract with the network, you interact with the messy world beyond Nix’s\ncontrol. But, at least, Nix can shout and abort the build, when your derivation\ndoes not produce the expected output.\nEnter caching (substitution)\nWe surely do not want to re-download the Internet, again, in every build.\nTherefore, Nix will helpfully cache the result by the name of the derivation and\nthe output hash.3 You have given Nix a promise: Trust me, whatever command I\nspecify, it will result in the given hash. If Nix can ascertain the right\nresult, why do all the hard work?\nPreventing huge rebuilds\nIt goes further than that. If we want to re-execute the derivation without\nmessing with our Nix store that acts like a cache, we will need to change the\noutput path. If we change the output path, all the beautiful derivations and\nprocess that output further, will need to be rebuilt.\nOoooh, that can be expensive. E.g. think of GNU libc. All the things we need to\nrebuild with exactly the same code that we happen to store at a different path!\nBack to the problem\nAll this very reasonable thinking leads to the problem with which I started this\narticle. The commands of the derivations are ignored if we already have a\nmatching derivation result!\nIn fact, Nixpkgs contains plenty of code that will typically be evaluated but\nnot executed\n\nbecause there is still a matching result in the cache. fetchurl etc. are all\nimplemented with FODs (Fixed Output Derivations), so that this applies to the\nhypothetical PR in which I change something like:\n\n    fetchurl {\n    \turl = \"https://pigeonhole.dovecot.org/releases/2.3/dovecot-2.3-pigeonhole-${version}.tar.gz\";\n    \tsha256 = \"0pk0579ifl3ymfzn505396bsjlg29ykwr7ag8prcbafayg4rrj28\";\n     }\n\nTo this:\n    fetchurl {\n    \turl = \"https://there.was.never.anything/here\";\n    \tsha256 = \"0pk0579ifl3ymfzn505396bsjlg29ykwr7ag8prcbafayg4rrj28\";\n     }\n\nAnd most likely, the CI job would rubber stamp this lovely PR while a human\nwould obviously object.\nNote that we can never ensure perfectly that an URL in a derivation still works\n-- it is outside of our control. But we could ensure that it worked at least\nonce. A big difference, in my opinion!\nRerunning FODs on all input changes\nAs an experiment, let’s see what is necessary to re-execute FODs (Fixed Output\nDerivations) on any input change.\nFODs are rebuilt when their output hash or their name changes. Therefore, if we\ninclude a hash over all inputs in the name, we rebuild the FOD on every input\nchange. We do this in four simple steps:\n\n\nTo get Nix to calculate that hash conveniently for us, we “unfix” the given\nFOD and create a normal derivation based on it:\nlet unfixedDerivation =\n    fixedOutputDerivation.overrideAttrs(attrs: {\n        outputHash = null;\n        outputHashAlgo = null;\n        outputHashMode = null;\n    });\n\n\n\nWe grab the output path with the hash:\nlet outputPath = builtins.unsafeDiscardStringContext unfixedDerivation.outPath;\n\nWe are using unsafeDiscardStringContext to make Nix allow us to use the\nstring as part of our name. Despite the name, it works in pure/strict eval\nmode and is quite harmless, yet unusual.\n\n\nExtract the hash:\nlet inputsHash = builtins.substring 11 32 outputPath;\n\n\n\nAnd use it as part of the derivation name:\nlet name = \"${inputsHash}_${name}\";\n\n\n\nYou have just created a Fixed Output Derivation that will re-execute whenever\nany of its inputs changes!\nRebalancing\nFor me, rebuilding FODs on every input change, would have been easier to\nunderstand. For small projects, it is even a reasonable approach. But for medium\nand larger projects, it is simply unacceptable: If we use this technique in\nthis extreme form, we will rebuild mostly everything if\n\nwe update curl,\nwe change the mirror list,\nany other input changes of fetchurl!\n\nFor medium-sized projects I’d recommend another approach:\n\nUse only your original Fixed Output Derivation as a dependency for your real\nbuild.\nThen, use the instrumented Fixed Output Derivation in your continuous\nintegration testing. That will rebuild all the Fixed Output Derivations\nthemselves on any input change but it stops there. Nothing that depends on\nthem needs to be rebuilt!\n\nFor huge projects like nixpkgs, further fine-tuning is desirable. For every\nchange on fetchurl, you may want to execute a couple of basic tests but you\nmay find it unnecessary to re-execute all fetchurls. In addition, you might want\nto execute each fetch at least once every 30 days or so, even without changes,\nso that you ensure the URLs are still meaningful. Elaborating on that\ndeserves another article.\nEasy Experimentation\nI have created a\n“rerunFixed”\nfunction which can be used like this:\nrerunOnChange {} myFixedOutputDerivation\n\nBy default, it will rerun the given FOD on every input change as a starting\npoint. You can pre-override the attrs before they are used for the hash\ncalculation:\nrerunOnChange {\n   \tpreOverrideAttrs = attrs: { irrelevant = null; };\n} myFixedOutputDerivation\n\nLook at the docs to see how you can tune it. And let me know via\nTwitter if you have questions or suggestions.\nFollow me if you want to see more articles like this.\nConclusion\nI think that it is worth-while checking that the code of your Fixed Output\nDerivations still work, occasionally. When and how often - that depends heavily\non the context. I am curious about what you come up with!\nThanks\nSpecial thanks to Andreas Rammhold (@andir0815)\nfor experimenting with the idea with me and telling me about\nunsafeDiscardStringContext. In my earlier prototype, I needed to do \"Import\nfrom Derivation\" to get rid of the string context!\nThank you to Florian Klink (@flokli) and Andi\n(again!) for giving me valuable feedback on an earlier draft of this article.\nMistakes are mine.\n1\nrunCommandLocal is from nixpkgs.\n\n2\nWhen running in sandboxed mode. Which you should to get all the beautiful\nproperties of Nix.\n\n3\nTo be more exact: Nix will check if the output path of the derivation\nalready exists locally or at any of the given remote substituters (like\ncache.nixos.org). The output path, in turn, depends on the name and the\noutputHash.\n\n","id":"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/nix-rerunning-fixed-output-derivations/","title":"Nix: Re-running fixed output derivations - at the right time"},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/nix-superglue-for-immutable-infrastructure/":{"body":"Or, how I rationalize my love of Nix.\nNix markets itself as a “package manager.” I’d say “A principled build tool for\neverything that actually works.”\nNix assembles your immutable infrastructure from thousands of little lego pieces\nand sticks them together with superglue. That super glue holds infinitely\nstrong but, at your discretion, it becomes malleable like playdough.\nThe adhesive might smell strongly academic and nausiate you. Then, you\nrealize that a handful of powerful concepts bind everything together and you\nbecome intoxicated.\nNix has been used to create a highly customizable collection of packages,\nNixpkgs, that is the core of a complete, modern Linux distribution. Imagine!\nDriving the build of all these different programs that make up a Linux\ndistribution...with one and only one build tool!\nYou can build your immutable infrastructure on top of that. With distributed,\nreproducible builds that can be shared between all of your team.\nHow does Nix work?\nAs all build systems, Nix splits the build into smaller build steps. One\nbuild step could compile a particular program to a binary. Another build step\ncould create a config file. The final build step might combine those into a\ndocker image.\nSimple? Nix calls these build steps “derivations.” Here you go, academic smell,\nbut it really just means “build step” with inputs that executes some code that\nspits out the output that you so desire.\nHermetic and reproducible lego pieces\nNix is a “hermetic build tool.” That means that it is very explicit and picky\nabout the inputs to your derivations:\n\nNix considers the compiler binary and other used tools as part of the\ninputs. A lot of build tools ignore this and consider your output\n“up-to-date” even though you just upgraded your compiler.\nNix needs to know the exact hashes1 of all inputs and uses them to detect\nchanges. If you use files from your local file system in the build, Nix\ncalculates their hash automatically for you. If you download it from\nelsewhere, you need to specify its hash yourself. All derivations are built\nin a sandbox to ensure that you don’t use undeclared inputs.\n\nThis picky behavior makes reproducible builds possible2 and allows Nix to\npull off some awesome tricks like:\n\nCaching the outputs of each build step: As long as your compiler produces\nthe same output with the same inputs, why repeat the build if the inputs\ndidn’t change?\nDistributing the build across multiple machines: If I copy all the inputs to\nanother machine, I can also build it there! I only need to copy the inputs\nthat the other machine doesn’t already have so that I can usually skip\ncopying the compiler.\n\nWhile your normal programming specific build tool (like npm, yarn, cargo, maven,\nsbt, leiningen) is usually not hermetic, some progamming language agnostic tools\nare (e.g. bazel, pants). Here we go, rock solid lego pieces. So, what makes Nix\nunique?\nNix, the language, glues it all together\nNix build files are written in the Nix programming language. At first, it looks\nlike an innocent little language with data types that are roughly equivalent to\nJSON but have different names: lists=arrays, attribute sets=object/map, strings,\nnumbers, booleans.\nBut on top of that, Nix is a pure lazy functional language. What does that mean?\nIt is an exciting and unusual choice for a build system! If you already had some\nexperience with pure lazy functional programming and you know these concepts,\ngood for you. For me, these concepts are mind-blowing.\nThe “pure” means that:\n\nevaluating a Nix build file purely returns a description of all build steps\n(“derivations”) and does not yet execute them (that would be impure). Only\nafter you finalized what you want to build, Nix looks at the graph of build\nsteps and executes them -- in parallel, where it can. In practice, that\nmeans that you can easily take an existing build graph and return a slightly\nmodified one without having to fear that you already invoked an expensive\nbuild step.3\ndebugging a Nix build file is easier because values don’t get changed behind\nthe scenes. Once set, you can rely on them staying the same.\n\n“Lazy” in this context means that like a good lazy programmer, it will avoid\ndoing unnecessary work. It will not evaluate all of your Nix code but only the\nparts that you explicitly use. E.g. you can use an attribute set (think JSON\nobject/map) with all packages in the NixOs distribution, pass it around as a\nwhole and not fear that your evaluation time explodes. Nix will only fully\nevaluate the packages that you then actually use in your build file.“Lazyness”\nallows a number of additional simple but powerful patterns that are beyond this\narticle.\nWhat does that mean in practice?\nNix empowers you to bend the build to your will.\n\nDo you want to ensure that all of your docker images use the exact same\nversion of openssl? Easy.\nDo you want to use mostly the versions of the libraries in NixOS but you\nwant to patch some with your magic source? You can. Everything that depends\non the magic source will be automatically rebuilt.\nDo you want to upgrade a risky new library explicitly and independently for\nevery container? Also possible.\nWhat about building all your docker images in two versions? One version with\nthe currently deployed RPC library and one with the upgraded one for A/B\ntesting. Not a problem! No need to write a second configuration for every\ncontainer, since you can easily abstract over all of your images. In fact,\nyou probably don’t even need to touch the individual container\nconfigurations at all if you do this.\n\nSo, what is the catch?\nI am in love with Nix and while I try to stick to facts, I cannot be fully\ntrusted. However, not everything is perfect in the Nix world. Here are three\ngotchas you will encounter digging into Nix:\n\nSome of Nix’s concepts are highly unusual and most people need some time to\nlet them sink in. I did!\nNix and its community are not very prescriptive. Sounds good? In a way it is,\nbut documentation often tells you what is possible and not so much if it is a\ngood idea. Discovering how to write “good Nix” was quite hard for me.\nNix is most fun if all your dependencies are Nix-ified. NixOS/Nixpkgs is a\nhuge package collection and has often got you covered but if not, you’ll have\nto work some and maybe some more to bootstrap. Since other build systems are\na lot more permissive, some tools in your software stack may use some clever\nhacks - such as downloading a binary in a build script if you are missing a\ndependency - that are not allowed in Nix. That said, if it is too hard, you\ncan just build this part outside of Nix and import it as a binary.4\nNix currently works well if either your particular language is well supported\nor you rather build your things inside nix with the original build tool -- in\none step. The second approach is easier but requires Nix to rebuild\neverything in that step when things change.\n\nYou might have guessed that I think these obstacles are well worth it!\nHow to get started\nYou can install Nix under any Linux distribution and Mac OS and then start\n“Nix-ifying” one little corner of your universe. Download it from\nthe Nix homepage.\nHow to best proceed from there depends on your learning style! There are a lot\nof resources on the Nix \"learn\" page.\n1\nA “cryptographic” hash, to be more exact. The hash allows Nix to quickly\nverify if anything at all in the input changed.\n\n2\nIf you only invoke a reproducible compiler in your derivation, then this\nstep will also be fully reproducible. Otherwise, the output is still cached and\nyour colleagues will get the same result in practice.\n\n3\nThe exception, that I know of, is the “import-from-derivation” feature.\n“import-from-derivation” allows you to build nix code with a tool of your choice\nand then include that in that same build.\n\n4\nBut Nix is addictive. There will be this nearly irresistable urge to build\nit in Nix. At least for me. ;)\n\n","id":"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/nix-superglue-for-immutable-infrastructure/","title":"Nix: Superglue for immutable infrastructure"},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/pages/":{"body":"","id":"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/pages/","title":""}},"docInfo":{"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/2023-nix-fetch-with-authentication/":{"body":833,"title":7},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/2023-nix-for-private-binaries/":{"body":900,"title":4},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/2023-nix-s3-store-authentication/":{"body":566,"title":6},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/2023-nix2container-everything-once/":{"body":446,"title":7},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/2023-user-vs-project-gitignore/":{"body":264,"title":6},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/2024-astro-starlight-with-nix/":{"body":574,"title":7},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/2024-flake-parts-nodejs-devshell/":{"body":753,"title":8},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/about/":{"body":53,"title":0},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/ffmpeg-elgato-camlink-4k/":{"body":890,"title":8},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/git-ssh-insteadof-https/":{"body":161,"title":6},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/nix-rerunning-fixed-output-derivations/":{"body":657,"title":8},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/nix-superglue-for-immutable-infrastructure/":{"body":716,"title":4},"https://blog.eigenvalue.net/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0}},"length":14},"lang":"English"};
