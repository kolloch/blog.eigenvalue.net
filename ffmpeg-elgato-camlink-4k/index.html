    <div class="post-content">
      <p>I am a wonnabe hobbiest filmmaker. Often, I only noticed problems with the raw
footage on my Desktop computer at home - long after I could correct them by a
simple retake. Wouldn't it be awesome to record your footage directly to your
laptop? Make the footage available to others in your team really quickly, maybe
by storing it on a server?</p>
<p>I want to do this on my XPS 13 since that is my most portable option. I should
note that my laptop is decent (Intel i7-8550U 1.8 GHz) but doesn't have a
discrete graphics card. In fact, I cannot even play back the 4K footage recorded
on my Fuji XT-3 with HEVC (h265) on my laptop without tweaking VLC. And even on
my hefty AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2950X 16-Core, I cannot encode on the CPU alone
in realtime.</p>
<p>Therefore, encoding in realtime should probably be impossible. Or not? I had to
try. Oh, and on Linux. <a href="https://nixos.org">NixOS</a> to be specific.</p>
<p>Note that this article is not full of deep insights but mostly contains things I
tried and then eventually worked. This kind of content has helped me
tremendously in the past, so let's dump it into the Interwebs.</p>
<h2 id="the-easy-way-obs">The easy way: OBS</h2>
<p>The first thing that I tried was OBS studio. Here is what somewhat worked for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I set the output of my camera to 4K, 16:9, 25 fps (full HD does not work)</li>
<li>I added a <code>Video Capture (V4L2)</code> source. I needed to set the video format to
<code>YV12</code> which is apparently an alias for <code>NV12</code>.</li>
<li>I added a <code>Audio Input Capture (Pulse Audio)</code> since the video source does not
include the audio.</li>
</ul>
<p>It somewhat worked. But it randomly stopped working. It dropped frames -- that
got better when I disabled the preview. Anyways, if you reading this some time
after I published this, give it a try, it might be the simplest option!</p>
<p>Therefore, I decided to use CLI tools to
understand what was going on and to ultimately have more control. I dabbled a
bit with <code>gstreamer</code> but ultimately chose <code>ffmpeg</code> because I found more and
better documentation for it and it seemed to work better.</p>
<h2 id="digging-deeper-required-software">Digging deeper: Required Software</h2>
<p>If you want to follow along, I installed these packages in NixOS by adding them
to my package list:</p>
<pre><code># Capturing and encoding
ffmpeg-full # My version was 4.2.2

# Inspect video devices etc.
v4l-utils
usbutils

# Hardware acceleration for encoding&#x2F;decoding
vaapiIntel
libva
libva-utils
</code></pre>
<h2 id="underlying-video-device">Underlying video device</h2>
<p><code>ffmpeg</code> and other CLI tools require us to specify the video device name -- at
least if you have multiple video inputs e.g. the built-in webcam and the Elgato
Camlink 4K. You can either use the <code>/dev/videoX</code> device name that you saw in OBS
Studio or find the device names with:</p>
<pre><code>v4l2-ctl --list-devices
Cam Link 4K: Cam Link 4K (usb-0000:39:00.0-1.2):
	&#x2F;dev&#x2F;video1
	&#x2F;dev&#x2F;video2
</code></pre>
<p>You can already use the device names (the first one for the Cam Link) that you
found here. The trouble is that these device names might depend on the order in
which the video devices are detected. To get a stable device name that works
across reboots in you shell scripts, you can look into <code>/dev/v4l/by-id</code>
directory to find a good stable device name. For my devicem it was
<code>/dev/v4l/by-id/usb-Elgato_Cam_Link_4K_0004550EAA000-video-index0</code>.</p>
<p>We'll refer to whatever device you have chosen with <code>V4L_DEVICE</code> later in the
text.</p>
<h2 id="playing-the-video-feed">Playing the video feed</h2>
<p>To check whether ffmpeg can play the stream, you can use:</p>
<p><code>ffplay -f v4l2 -i $V4L_DEVICE</code></p>
<p>That is super simple, isn't it? It even detects the video format correctly. If
it doesn't for you, try specifying one with <code>-input_format</code>, e.g. <code>-input_format nv12</code> before the <code>-i</code>.</p>
<h2 id="capture-the-video-feed">Capture the video feed</h2>
<p>What does <code>ffmpeg</code> do by default? Let's see by exchanging <code>ffplay</code> with <code>ffmpeg</code>
and specifying an output file:</p>
<p><code>ffmpeg -f v4l2 -i $V4L_DEVICE capture.mkv</code></p>
<p>Hey, that works! But only barely. </p>
<ul>
<li>I cannot encode the video in real time and the video is buffered. The raw
video feed with 29.97 fps clocks in at about 3Gb/s, a bit less for 25 fps. If
we can't keep up, ffmpeg buffers the rest in main memory. So only suitable for
quite short videos ;)</li>
<li>Also, the output is ugly, we need to specify something nicer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hardware-encoding-to-the-rescue">Hardware-encoding to the rescue</h2>
<p>Since my laptop does not have a discrete graphics card, I am using the &quot;VAAPI&quot;
standard which is supported by newer Intel CPUs.</p>
<pre><code>ffmpeg -vaapi_device &#x2F;dev&#x2F;dri&#x2F;renderD128 \
  -f v4l2 -input_format nv12 -i $V4L_DEVICE \
  -vf &#x27;hwupload&#x27; \
  -c:v hevc_vaapi -b:v 100M -maxrate:v 120M capture.mkv
</code></pre>
<p>Woooh! That's a lot to understand.</p>
<p>Let's start with the basics: A basic ffmpeg command consists of a some global
flags (<code>-vaapi_device /dev/dri/renderD128</code> in this case) list of inputs (<code>-i ...</code>) and a list of outputs (e.g. file names). Local options effect the next
input or output, so decoding options are specified before an input, encoding
options for the output are specified before the output file name. <code>-f v4l2 -input_format nv12</code> apply to the input. <code>-c:v hevc_vaapi -b:v 100M -maxrate:v 120M</code> all apply to the output <code>capture.mkv</code>.</p>
<p>Between our input and the output, there is a <code>-vf</code> video filter command which
can be used to process the raw video. You could scale the video, transform the
color space, things like that. In our case, we need to make the video stream
available in the hardware encoder with <code>hwupload</code>. That seems to a bit of a
specialty with the VAAPI support. In my short experimentation with the NVIDIA
support (<code>nvenc</code>) on another machine, I didn't need something similar.</p>
<p><code>-c:v hevc_vaapi</code> is used to choose the video codec (<code>-c</code> is for codec, <code>:v</code> is
for video) from a long list of supported once. The codecs that use VAAPI have
a <code>_vaapi</code> suffix by convention.</p>
<p>Without specifying the wanted and maximum bit rate, I got a stream with low
quality. Therefore, I specified <code>-b:v 100M -maxrate:v 120M</code> to aim at quite high
quality. The highest quality setting on the X-T3 for 4K 25fps is 400Mbs, so it
might be even worth to experiment with higher settings. Note that there is a
<a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/7629">bug</a> that requires you to specify a
maxrate that is not much higher than the wanted bit rate.</p>
<p>Using VAAPI, I could encode 25 fps in realtime. Unfortunately, 29.97 is already
too much. That unfortunately also means that my plan to encode a smaller,
low-quality stream at the same time, also failed.</p>
<p><a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Hardware/VAAPI">The FFMPEG VAAPI Wiki
Page</a> gives context and many useful
examples if you want to know more.</p>
<h2 id="audio-source">Audio source</h2>
<p>The audio feed is - unfortunately - separate from the video feed.</p>
<p>First, let me save you a day of fiddling. Don't use ALSA directly, use
PulseAudio directly if you use it on your system. Using ALSA directly from
ffmpeg resulted in clapping a lot to debug audio sync issues and thus driving my
girl-friend insane.</p>
<p>Use <code>pactl list sources</code> to output tons of information about your audio sources.</p>
<p>Choose the right device and pick the name. For me, it was
<code>alsa_input.usb-Elgato_Systems_Cam_Link-03.iec958-stereo</code>.</p>
<h2 id="capture-the-audio-feed">Capture the audio feed</h2>
<p>This is straight-forward, we just have to specify that we want to use PulseAudio
(by <code>-f pulse</code>) and specify the device name as input.</p>
<pre><code>ffmpeg -f pulse -i alsa_input.usb-Elgato_Systems_Cam_Link-03.iec958-stereo capture.mp3
</code></pre>
<p>We skip compression to save some CPU when we do everything together later on:</p>
<pre><code>ffmpeg -f pulse -i alsa_input.usb-Elgato_Systems_Cam_Link-03.iec958-stereo \
    -c:a copy capture.wav
</code></pre>
<p><code>-c:a copy</code> set the audio codec to <code>copy</code> which skips any audio encoding. In
this case, it is redundant since the output format doesn't support any special
codec anyways. It becomes relevant when we combine it with video.</p>
<h2 id="putting-it-together-doesn-t-work">Putting it together... doesn't work</h2>
<p>This mostly combines our video/audio examples and adds a <code>-thread_queue_size 2048</code> to allow some generous buffering:</p>
<pre><code>fmpeg -vaapi_device &#x2F;dev&#x2F;dri&#x2F;renderD128 \
    -i $V4L_DEVICE \
    -thread_queue_size 2048 -f pulse -i $PULSE_DEVICE \
    -vf &#x27;format=nv12,hwupload&#x27; \
    -c:v hevc_vaapi -b:v 100M -maxrate:v 120M \
    -acodec copy \
    output-combined.mkv
</code></pre>
<p>This should be the final section, right? I'd hope so but for me this wasn't true
at all.</p>
<p>This might work for you. For me, it also worked once or so. Unfortunately, most
of the time it will get stuck after two frames. After some random
experimentation, I noticed that unplugging the device allowed me to record once,
most of the time. I think that it is due to syncing the audio / video stream.
The video source seems to request key frames doesn't get the expected data
afterwards. Or something else.</p>
<h2 id="resetting-the-usb-device-without-unplugging">Resetting the USB device without unplugging</h2>
<p>That's not nice but can we at least automate it? After some browsing, I found
this recipe on <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/61165">Ask Ubuntu</a>:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo sh -c &quot;echo 0 &gt; &#x2F;sys&#x2F;bus&#x2F;usb&#x2F;devices&#x2F;1-4.6&#x2F;authorized&quot;
sudo sh -c &quot;echo 1 &gt; &#x2F;sys&#x2F;bus&#x2F;usb&#x2F;devices&#x2F;1-4.6&#x2F;authorized&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I created two shell scripts </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kolloch/elgato_capture/blob/d5a023d68c7b25727277b8b15e71e19492cbe545/find-elgato4k-sys-dir.sh">find-elgato4k-sys-dir.sh</a>
to find the right sys directory and </li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kolloch/elgato_capture/blob/d5a023d68c7b25727277b8b15e71e19492cbe545/reset.sh">reset.sh</a>
to issue these commands and wait for the device to come up again.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>After calling <code>reset.sh</code>, the combined command works reliably for me. And I have
a new found respect for the codecs in my camera.</p>
